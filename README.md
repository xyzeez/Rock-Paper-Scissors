# About Project

This is a project from the Odenproject's foundations course on Javascript basics. 

I have implemented the methodologies learnt from the lesson on this version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors project. 

Although this one works as it should, on the [main branch](https://github.com/xyzeez/Rock-Paper-Scissors/tree/main) is more prefered as it contains more styling and improved functionalities so you can check that out or see it live [Here](https://rock-paper-scissors-xyz.netlify.app/).
